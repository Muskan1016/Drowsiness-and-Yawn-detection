# Drowsiness-and-Yawn-detection
This project aims to detect the Drowsiness in drivers to prevent accidents and improve the safety on the highways. In this, we study whether drivers' eyes remain closed for more than a certain period; drivers are drowsy, and an alarm is sounded. Yawn similarly is detected when a person yawns several times.
